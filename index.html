  <strong>Short bio:</strong>
  I obtained my PhD in 2016 from the Queensland University of Technology under the supervision of Prof. Simon Lucey at CSIRO.
  Since then, I have worked as a post-doc with Prof. Philip Torr at the University of Oxford, a research scientist at Google in France with Prof. Cordelia Schmid, and a research fellow at the University of Adelaide.
  I originally studied Mechatronic Engineering at the University of Queensland and I used to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210223203312/http://robocup.quantumtorque.com/de/">build robots in high school</a>.
