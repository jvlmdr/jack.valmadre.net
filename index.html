  I'm a researcher working on computer vision and deep learning.
  I'm passionate about using mathematics and programming to find elegant solutions to problems in machine learning.
  My research interests include optimisation, signal processing, structured prediction, weak supervision, zero- and few-shot learning, object tracking, out-of-distribution generalisation and long-tail learning.

  <strong>Short bio:</strong>
  I obtained my PhD in 2016 from Queensland University of Technology under the supervision of Prof. Simon Lucey at CSIRO.
  After my PhD, I was a post-doc with Prof. Philip Torr at the University of Oxford, and then spent two and a half years at Google France, working with Prof. Cordelia Schmid.
  I studied Mechatronic Engineering at the University of Queensland and I used to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210223203312/http://robocup.quantumtorque.com/de/">build robots in high school</a>.
