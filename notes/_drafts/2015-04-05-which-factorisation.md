title:  Which factorisation to use for a linear system of equations?
math:   true

When solving $$A x = b$$, the properties of $$A$$ determine which algorithm should be used.

Matrices which are arbitrary (SVD), full rank (LU), square (QR, LQ), symmetric (LDL), positive-definite (Cholesky).

Does LDL handle matrices with eigenvalues of zero?
