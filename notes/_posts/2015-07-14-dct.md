The Discrete Fourier Transform and its inverse are linear operators that map periodic signals to periodic signals

$$
(\F x)[k] = \sum_{t = 0}^{m - 1} x[t] e^{-i 2 \pi k t / m} = (\F x)[k + m]
$$

$$
(\F^{-1} x)[k] = \sum_{t = 0}^{m - 1} x[t] e^{i 2 \pi k t / m} = (\F^{-1} x)[k + m] \enspace .
$$

Any signal with period $$m$$ can be defined in terms of a finite vector of length $$m$$ using the periodic extension operator $$\P$$ defined $$(\P u)[t] = u[t \bmod m]$$.
Whereas $$\F$$ is the infinite transform, which maps periodic signals to periodic signals, let $$F$$ denote the finite transform (matrix), which maps vectors to vectors.
These are related through the periodic extension operator

$$
\F \P = \P F \enspace .
$$

since $$\F \P u = \P F u$$ for all $$u$$.


## The DCT-1

Similarly to the DFT, the Discrete Trigonometric Transforms are linear operators that map real and symmetric periodic signals to real and symmetric periodic signals.
If $$x$$ is a periodic signal $$x[t] = x[t + m]$$ that is real and symmetric $$x[-t] = x[t]$$ and has even period $$m = 2 n$$, then its Fourier transform

$$
\begin{align}
(\F x)[k] & = \sum_{t = 0}^{2 n - 1} x[t] e^{-i 2 \pi k t / 2 n} \\
& = x[0]
  + \sum_{t = 1}^{n - 1} x[t] e^{-i \pi k t / n}
  + x[n] (-1)^{k}
  + \sum_{t = 1}^{n - 1} x[2 n - t] e^{-i \pi k (2 n - t) / n} \\
& = x[0]
  + \sum_{t = 1}^{n - 1} x[t] \left( e^{-i \pi k t / n} + e^{i \pi k t / n} \right)
  + x[n] (-1)^{k} \\
& = x[0] + \sum_{t = 1}^{n - 1} 2 x[t] \cos(\pi k t / n) + (-1)^{k} x[n] \enspace .
\end{align}
$$

is also real and symmetric periodic $$(\F x)[-t] = (\F x)[t]$$.
This is, in fact, the definition of the DCT-1.
Whereas the DFT is defined for complex periodic signals, the DCT-1 is only defined for real and symmetric periodic signals.

Let $$E_{\wsws}$$ be a $$2 n \times (n+1)$$ matrix that maps an arbitrary vector to one period of a symmetric periodic signal

$$
E_{\wsws} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ & 1 \\ & & \cdot \\ & & & 1 \\ & & & & 1 \\ & & & 1 \\ & & \cdot \\ & 1 \end{bmatrix}
$$

such that

$$
(E_{\wsws} u)[t] = \begin{cases}
  u[t] & \text{if } 0 \le t < n + 1 \\
  u[2 n - t] & \text{if } n + 1 \le t < 2 n
\end{cases}
$$

and let $$\E_{\wsws} = \P E_{\wsws}$$ be the linear operator that maps an arbitrary vector to a symmetric periodic signal.
The reason for the "WSWS" subscript will become evident later on.
Any symmetric periodic signal $$x$$ can be defined in terms of a finite vector $$x = \E_{\wsws} u$$.
Since the DCT-1 is equal to the DFT for symmetric periodic signals, the two transforms are related

$$
\F \E_{\wsws} = \C_{1} \E_{\wsws} \enspace .
$$

### Finite Transform

If $$x$$ is real and symmetric periodic, then its transform $$\C_{1} x$$ is also real and symmetric periodic.
Therefore there exist vectors $$u$$ and $$\hat{u}$$ such that $$x = \E_{\wsws} u$$ and $$\C_{1} x = \E_{\wsws} \hat{u}$$.
The finite DCT-1 transform is defined as the $$(n+1) \times (n+1)$$ matrix $$C_{1}$$ that relates the unique elements of these two signals $$\hat{u} = C_{1} u$$.
The infinite and finite DCT-1 operators are therefore related

$$
\C_{1} \E_{\wsws} = \E_{\wsws} C_{1} \enspace .
$$

The finite DCT-1 is related to the finite DFT

$$
F E_{\wsws} = E_{\wsws} C_{1}
$$

since $$\F \E_{\wsws} = \F \P E_{\wsws} = \P F E_{\wsws}$$ and $$\C_{1} \E_{\wsws} = \E_{\wsws} C_{1} = \P E_{\wsws} C_{1}$$.

To obtain an explicit expression for $$C_{1}$$ in terms of $$F$$, let $$E_{\wsws}^{-1}$$ denote a matrix that is the left inverse of $$E_{\wsws}$$ such that

$$
E_{\wsws}^{-1} E_{\wsws} = I \enspace .
$$

This is an $$(n+1) \times 2 n$$ matrix that extracts the unique elements from one period of a symmetric periodic signal.
Using the left inverse yields

$$
C_{1} = E_{\wsws}^{-1} F E_{\wsws} \enspace .
$$

### Convolution

The relationship with the Fourier transform can be used to obtain a convolution theorem for symmetric signals.
The convolution of two symmetric periodic signals is a symmetric periodic signal

$$
\E_{\wsws} u * \E_{\wsws} v = \E_{\wsws} w
$$

whose unique elements are related by the finite transform

$$
C_{1} w = C_{1} u \odot C_{1} v \enspace .
$$

#### Proof

Let $$z = \E_{\wsws} u * \E_{\wsws} v$$.
Its Fourier transform is

$$
\F z
= (\F \E_{\wsws} u) \odot (\F \E_{\wsws} v)
= (\E_{\wsws} C_{1} u) \odot (\E_{\wsws} C_{1} v)
$$

using the Fourier convolution theorem and the properties of the DCT-1.
Since the product of two symmetric signals is symmetric, this can be expressed

$$
\F z = \E_{\wsws} (C_{1} u \odot C_{1} v) \enspace .
$$

Since the Fourier transform of $$z$$ is real and symmetric, $$z$$ itself must be real and symmetric $$z = E_{\wsws} w$$, and the elements of $$w$$ must satisfy

$$
\begin{align}
\E_{\wsws} u * \E_{\wsws} v & = \E_{\wsws} w \\
\E_{\wsws} (C_{1} u \odot C_{1} v) & = \E_{\wsws} C_{1} w \enspace .
\end{align}
$$

q.e.d.

### Orthogonality

The finite DFT is orthogonal $$F^{H} F = F F^{H} = m I$$, which gives Parseval's theorem $$\|F x\|^{2} = m \|x\|^{2}$$.
The finite DCT-1 is not orthogonal, although it does satisfy

$$
\| E_{\wsws} C u \|^{2} = \| F E_{\wsws} u \|^{2} = m \| E_{\wsws} u \|^{2}
$$

due to the orthogonality of the Fourier transform.
Substitute $$D = E_{\wsws}^{T} E_{\wsws}$$ with $$D = (D^{\frac{1}{2}})^{2}$$ diagonal and invertible to give

$$
\| D^{\frac{1}{2}} C D^{-\frac{1}{2}} u \|^{2}
= \| E_{\wsws} C D^{-\frac{1}{2}} u \|^{2}
= m \| E_{\wsws} D^{-\frac{1}{2}} u \|^{2}
= m \| u \|^{2} \enspace .
$$

Therefore, while $$C_{1}$$ is not orthogonal, $$\tilde{C}_{1} = D^{\frac{1}{2}} C_{1} D^{-\frac{1}{2}}$$ is.
This is known as the orthogonal form of the DCT-1.
The diagonal matrix $$D$$ counts the number of times each unique element appears in the symmetric periodic extension

$$
D = E^{T}_{\wsws} E_{\wsws}
= \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ & 2 \\ && 2 \\ &&& \cdot \\ &&&& 2 \\ &&&&& 1 \end{bmatrix} \enspace .
$$


## More general symmetry

This section will introduce the DST-1, DCT-2 and DST-2 and generalise the above results.

## Even more general symmetry

There are a total of sixteen DTTs, of which only four have been discussed so far.
To compute the convolution of signals that are anti-periodic, i.e. that have one symmetric and one anti-symmetric reflection, it is necessary to introduce the DCT- and DST-3 and -4.
To handle signals that have mixed whole and half symmetry, and therefore odd period, it is necessary to introduce the -odd variant of every transform.
For the gritty details, refer to Stephen Martucci's paper and PhD thesis.
